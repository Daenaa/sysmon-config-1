**A) Summary**

Sysmon has two configuration type:

1- Targetting: These configuration's will collect logs of special events and useful for Threat Hunting

2- Tracking: These configuration's will collect more logs (also some noisy logs) to fill dashboards abd useful for SOC and correlation engines.


I create this mixed configuration. I fork sysmon modular and then mix it with other fork's and my knowledge about detection and threat hunting.


Note: This configuration will raise your events (5x of sysmon modular default configuration), so be careful and re-calculate your license, resource's data lifecycle policie's.

**C) Installation (and make it secure)**

0) We want to install sysmon a little different to 

1.1) Download last version of Sysmon from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) or [Sysinternals](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Sysmon.zip).

1.2) Download symon cofig file in here [(Download)](https://github.com/pcsg-community/sysmon-config/blob/main/sysmon-pcsg-daena-default.xml) and copy in you downloaded sysmon folder.

2) Rename "sysmon64.exe" or "sysmon.exe" to another name, to hide it (with different name) in process list. for example we rename "sysmon64.exe" to "pcsgmon.exe"

3.1) Run powershell or cmd with Admin Rights (Run as Admin) and change path to your sysmon folder

3.2) command: pcsgmon.exe -accepteula -i "sysmon-pcsg-daena-default.xml"
