**A) Summary**

Sysmon has two configuration type:

1- Targetting: These configuration's will collect logs of special events and useful for Threat Hunting

2- Tracking: These configuration's will collect more logs (also some noisy logs) to fill dashboards abd useful for SOC and correlation engines.


I create this mixed configuration. I fork sysmon modular and then mix it with other fork's and my knowledge about detection and threat hunting.


Note: This configuration will raise your events (5x of sysmon modular default configuration), so be careful and re-calculate your license, resource's data lifecycle policie's.
