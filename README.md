Sysmon has two configuration type:
1- Targetting: These configuration's will collect logs of special events and useful for Threat Hunting
2- Tracking: These configuration's will collect more logs (also some noisy logs) to fill dashboards abd useful for SOC and correlation engines.

I create this mixed configuration.

Note: This configuration will raise your events (5x of sysmon modular default configuration), so be careful and re-calculate your license, resource's data lifecycle policie's.
